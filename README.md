# Youtube_data_gathering
I leveraged my prior experience working with the YouTube API to develop a relational database containing information about Greek YouTube party channels.
In the initial phase of the project, I formulated the foundational classes housing functions responsible for creating the SQLite3 database. Subsequently, the following stage involves implementing machine learning models aimed at extracting meaningful insights from the dataset.
 This is a work in progress!!
